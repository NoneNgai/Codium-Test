4. (Python specific) In Python, what is the difference between else and finally in exception handling?
In Python, else will execute if no exception occurs, but finally will still run after every block executes even if an exception occurs. 
So the difference between else and finally in terms of exception handling is that else will run like a normal code if no exception occurs, 
but after the exception handling part, but finallyÂ whatever you do in the exception handling block finally will be executed.
